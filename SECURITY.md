# Security

Embed My has no accounts, no server and no data of its own: the site is static files on GitHub Pages, and
an H5P package plays in the visitor's browser. What can go wrong is therefore in one of two places.

- **The player** (how a package is read and run, the worker, the frame it builds): report it under the
  [h5p-offline-player security policy](https://github.com/missing-elements/h5p-offline-player/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
- **This site** (the snippet it writes, the preview, the guides, the pages' Content-Security-Policy):
  report it privately through
  [GitHub's security advisory form](https://github.com/embed-my/website/security/advisories/new)
  for this repository, not as a public issue.
- **The player origin** (the `/h5p` page and `h5p-resizer.js` on embed-my.github.io): the same, in
  [embed-my/embed-my.github.io](https://github.com/embed-my/embed-my.github.io/security/advisories/new).

Please include the address you used, the browser, and what you expected to happen. There is no bounty; there
is a thank-you in the release notes if you want one.

## What is by design

- The `/h5p` page runs any package a link names, as any H5P site runs the packages uploaded to it. It runs on
  the player origin, `embed-my.github.io`, apart from the embedding site and from this one, with storage
  partitioned per embedding site. What a
  hostile package can do there is described in the [privacy and security guide](https://embed-my.org/docs/privacy-and-security).
- The pages carry their policy in a `<meta>` tag, written at build, because GitHub Pages sends no security
  headers. A `<meta>` policy cannot set `frame-ancestors`; `/h5p` is meant to be framed by anyone.
